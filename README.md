# Pokemon Exploration

## Description
A Pokemon exploration app for the Atomic Jolt Internship Coding Challenge. I chose option A and focused on the frontend. 

Users can search, browse, and view detailed information about Pokemon in a clean, image-rich interface. 

I chose the Pokemon API for its excellent documentation and visual appeal. Out of the three API options, it was the only API with sprite images, which I felt would make for a more engaging user interface and user experience. 

It is built with Vite + React and CSS.


## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Search for Pokemon by name
- **Browse Pokemon**: View a grid of Pokemon cards with images
- **Detailed Information**: See stats and information for each Pokemon
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern interface built with React and CSS


## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/bradenpeterson/PokemonExplorer.git
cd PokemonExplorer
```

2. Navigate to project folder
```
cd pokemon-explorer
```

3. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server
```
npm run dev
```

5. Open the URL shown in the terminal output, typically `http://localhost:5173`


## AI Usage
I firmly believe that AI will be the future of programming, technology, and innovation as a whole. With that in mind, I utilized several AI tools throughout this project. I used Claude to help outline a guide and plan of action for this project, and I used VS Code's built-in GitHub Copilot to streamline parts of the coding process. I reviewed and verified that all AI-generated suggestions were accurate and correct.


## Additional Time
I spent around three hours completing this project. If I had additional time, I would implement a feature where users can click on a Pokemon card and be directed to a page with a more in-depth look at the selected Pokemon, with a larger image and more detailed stats.
