# AtomicJoltCodingChallenge

## Description
A Pokemon exploration app for the Atomic Jolt Internship Coding Challenge. I chose option A and focused on the frontend. 

Users can search, browse, and view detailed information about Pokemon in a clean, image-rich interface. 

I chose the Pokemon API for its excellent documentation and visual appeal. Out of the three API options, it was the only API with sprite images, which I felt would make for a more enganging user interface and user experience. 

It is built with React and CSS.
